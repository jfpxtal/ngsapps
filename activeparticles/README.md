# Active Particles
This is an implementation of the active particles model by Stenhammar et al. ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01836))

From the article: "Self-propelled particles that swim in response to light can self-assemble microfluidic rectification devices under non-uniform illumination."

We implemented the continuum model in both 1D and 2D as well as the stochastic model in 2D. For the continuum model, we used a simple explicit Euler scheme.

| `continuum.py` | Continuum model in 2D as described in eqs. (3)-(4) of the paper. We implemented the annulus light field from fig. 4 in `../utils/annulusspeedcf.*pp`. |
| `settings.py` | Some 2D geometries used by `continuum.py` |
| `continuum_topf.py` | Version of `continuum.py` to run on server, this was used to generate the data in `data/` |
| `continuum_vis.py` | Visualization of the data in `data/`. The current ngsolve version seems to have changed the degrees of freedom of the FESpace, which broke visualization of data generated by an older version. Last known to work with ngsolve commit sha `1580d867c5bfe43e9`. |
| `data/supp/` | Data generated by `continuum_topf.py` with `vout=0.1` |
| `data/vout0/` | Data generated by `continuum_topf.py` with `vout=0` |
| `oned.py` | Continuum model in 1D (fig. 3) |
| `sde.py` | Discrete / stochastic model from eqs. (1)-(2), fig. 2. Current implementation is too slow. |
